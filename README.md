## Objective
- The main objective of this study is to determine top predictive variables capable of estimating housing prices using regularization techniques.

## Study Details
- The housing company is interested in buying prospective properties below the fair price and sell them at high price in future.
- Historical data set of defaulted loans and fully paid loans is provided.
- The goal is to perform the following activities using the historical data
  - **Data Understanding**: Understand various attributes of data and their types.
  - **Data Cleaning**: Perform tasks such as handling missing values, handling outliers, etc
  - **Data Analysis**: Perform various analysis for 
  - **Recommendations**: Provide the details of 5 good indicators found in above analysis
  - **Model Building**: Build models using regularization techniques such as Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Ridge model is choosen as the best model.
- Top predictive variables are:
  - 1stFlrSF,
  - PoolQC_Gd,
  - OverallQual_10,
  - GrLivArea, 
  - OverallQual_9
